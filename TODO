Task list for $10 ATA

[ ] create SVN repository
    [ ] Apply for SF project
    [ ] check in

[ ] Draw schematic
    [X] DC-DC converter
    [X] hook detection
    [ ] tx audio
    [ ] rx audio

[ ] AVR code
    [ ] build up basic Vbat on hook/Ibat off hook main loop
        [ ] single shot ADC mode
        [ ] then move to clocked mode
            [ ] measure conversion rate
    [X] resolder hardware neatly
    [ ] add audio tx/rx code 
        [ ] work out how to sample hook detect without messing up audio
        [ ] work out how to handle full duplex audio and flow control to host
    [ ] test full duplex audio 
        + run resample code on x86 host
    [ ] implement echo canceller
    [ ] implement closed loop Ibat regulation that is audio noise free
        
[ ] Safety features
    [ ] lightning protection
        + a likely event in developing world target markets
    [ ] ring voltage protection
        + what affect will ring voltage have on rx audio A/D inputs
        + will it pass thru coupling caps?
        + perhaps AVR has protection diodes that will handle it?
    [ ] Watchdog emergency cut out
        + say if uC hangs at point where duty cycle
          of DC-DC PWM is high
        + way to cut PWM pulses to DC-DC converter
    [ ] Over current cut out
    
[ ] risks
    [ ] how to sample Vbat (for hook switch) at same
        time as sampling audio
        + maybe steal 1 in 1000 samples?
    [ ] does A/D sample at same speed as PWM (16kHz)
    [ ] differential issues
        + try a 20m cable run, see if there is any hum on audio
